# Dekho: A Journey into Audio/Video Streaming

## Some Achievements ✨

We launched [Dekho](https://peerlist.io/dheerajlalwani/project/dekho) on [Peerlist](https://peerlist.io) in the 3rd Week of January 2025 and we had a pretty good response.

## Overview

Dekho is a research and study project aimed at understanding and learning about audio and video streaming. Our primary focus was on implementing the [HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)](https://developer.apple.com/streaming) protocol to build an on-demand video streaming server.

## Setup Instructions

### Basic Steps

- Clone the repository
- Create an **_[Appwrite storage bucket](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/storage)_**
  - Make sure that you make a note of `APPWRITE_KEY`, `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID` and the `BUCKET_ID`.

### With Docker

- Install `docker-compose` on your machine.
- cd into the root of the repository.
  - Create a `.env` file using **_[.env.docker](.env.docker)_** as a reference.
- Just run `docker-compose up` to start the server.

### Without Docker

- Install the `make` utility because we have created a **_[Makefile](Makefile)_** to ease the setup
- Now we are moving to the dependency installation steps.
- This project needs `go version go1.23`, `ffmpeg` utility and `psql (PostgreSQL) 16.3` database.
- To install these, and the Go dependencies, run `make install-dev`.
  - The `make install-dev` takes care of installing PostgreSQL, Go, FFMpeg, golang-migrate and Go dependencies.
  - Run `make start-postgres` to start the postgres service.
  - Create a database user by running this command `sudo -u postgres createuser -s username_here -P`
  - `-P` will prompt for a password.
  - Enter the `psql` shell by running this command `sudo -u postgres psql` and create a database by running `CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;`.
  - Create a `.env` file using **_[.env.local](.env.local)_** as a reference.
- Once the dependencies are installed successfully, run `make cleanstart`.
- This command will create all the necessary folders and start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- If you just want to run the server, run: `make start`
- If you just want to clean up, run: `make clean`

## Technologies Used

- **Server:** Go

## Key Resources

Our journey has been greatly enriched by the insights and guidance from various resources. A pivotal article that set us on the right path is "[Learning the basics of video streaming with Golang](https://www.rohitmundra.com/video-streaming-server)" by [Rohit Mundra](https://twitter.com/brohit3).

For a comprehensive list of resources that have been instrumental in our learning and development process, please refer to our [documentation](https://github.com/Chirag-And-Dheeraj/video-streaming-server/blob/main/documentation/video-streaming-project-stuff/links.md).
